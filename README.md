# @shapeshift-labs/loom

Loom is the repo-level semantic collaboration CLI for Frontier projects and
non-Frontier codebases. It creates a `.loom/` workspace, scans source files into
Frontier semantic graph records, tracks repo status, emits projection plans, and
delegates agent work to the existing Frontier Swarm tooling.

```sh
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom init
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom scan
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom status
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom snapshot -m "semantic checkpoint"
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom cat-file <object-id> --json
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom project --to python
npx @shapeshift-labs/loom swarm collect --run agent-runs/my-run
```

## CLI

- `loom init` creates `loom.json`, `.loomignore`, and the generated `.loom/`
  directories.
- `loom scan` writes `.loom/graph/current.json` and
  `.loom/objects/source-index.json`.
- `loom status` summarizes config, graph, git, and semantic import health.
- `loom graph` prints the current graph summary or full graph with `--json`.
- `loom diff` compares the current files against the saved graph.
- `loom snapshot` stores a Git-familiar semantic snapshot: a tree object, a
  snapshot object, a ref update, and a reflog entry.
- `loom cat-file <object-id>` prints a stored semantic object.
- `loom project --to <target>` writes a projection plan under
  `.loom/projections/`.
- `loom doctor` checks that the Frontier packages Loom uses are resolvable.
- `loom swarm ...` passes through to `@shapeshift-labs/frontier-swarm-codex`.

## Programmatic API

```ts
import { initLoomProject, scanLoomProject, readLoomStatus } from '@shapeshift-labs/loom';

await initLoomProject({ root: process.cwd(), name: 'my-app' });
const scan = await scanLoomProject({ root: process.cwd() });
const status = await readLoomStatus({ root: process.cwd() });

console.log(scan.graph.summary, status.ready);
```

## `.loom` Layout

Loom borrows Git's familiar shape without using Git's object format:

- `.loom/objects/xx/<hash>.json` stores immutable semantic records.
- `.loom/refs/**` stores small mutable pointers to snapshot and graph objects.
- `.loom/HEAD` is a symbolic ref, initialized to `refs/heads/main`.
- `.loom/index.json` is the flat scan index used to create snapshots.
- `.loom/logs/**` records ref updates.

Loom is intentionally a CLI layer. The semantic AST, source import, projection,
patch, swarm, and merge primitives stay in the existing Frontier packages.
